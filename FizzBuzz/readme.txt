The task is to output a sequence of numbers from 1 to a certain number (usually 100), but with certain substitutions:

If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
If the number is a multiple of 5, output "Buzz" instead of the number.
If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 at the same time, output "FizzBuzz".
