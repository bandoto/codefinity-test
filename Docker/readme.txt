This code is a simple simulation of some of the steps involved in containerization using Unix tools. 
It uses comments that simulate the execution of commands that create archives, configure resource limits, and run processes in virtual environments.

**Using**

1. Specify the path for the archive **containerPath**, the name of the container group **cgroupName**, the memory limit **memoryLimit**, the **command** command and the **args** arguments.
2. Call functions to create an archive, configure namespaces, set resource limits, and run a container process in an isolated environment.
